# Comparing implementations of Dirichlet Process Mixture (DPM) models

A placehold to gather some code and thoughts about comparing ways to implement DPMs using the truncation approximation and stick-breaking construction.

To start we are looking into:

- Nimble (https://r-nimble.org/nimbleExamples/bnp_density.html)
- Turing.jl (https://turinglang.org/docs/tutorials/infinite-mixture-models/)
